// want to test firebase app out. Want to have app that interacts
//with the user,and uses in app messaging with FireBase 

//will need a main function with the ability to add users to an object 
//or an array to document and leave open the ability to communicate with 
//each user. 
    //within the function I will need a loop to check for responses 
    // buttons for submission (may use a Form Style format on Bootstrap)

//will need vars but not sure where yet putting them here until I find a spot
//will have a userComment
const userComment= "";


    //creating an on click function tied to the created class1 in the empty div
$(document).on("click", ".class1", function(){
        //trying to set up a var for class1 so that I can console log it easier
    let class1 = $(".class1");
    console.log("This is class1: " + class1);

    

})
